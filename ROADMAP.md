# Roadmap
These are listed in order of priority, but are subject to change. I will attempt to release something every 1-2 weeks depending on my own circumstances.

### Short Term

* ThemeProvider - updates to make this easier to apply themes from a primary color.
* SensorCard - a card to display sensor entities with graphs of history (history may not be available via websockets)
* CameraCard - a card to display camera entities
* CalendarCard - a card to display calendar events
* VacuumCard - a card to display vacuum entities


### Long Term

* Full responsive layouts with the hope of an editor with drag and drop support.
* REST API inclusion - there's some data/operations that are simply not available on the websocket API, so I'll be adding a REST API to expand on functionality.
