# Roadmap
These are listed in order of priority, but are subject to change. I will attempt to release something every 1-2 weeks depending on my own circumstances.

### Short Term

* EntitiesCard - updates to allow simple controls like toggling a light/switch, or opening a cover
* CameraCard - a card to display camera entities
* VacuumCard - a card to display vacuum entities
* ButtonCard - Different layout designs, including slider indicator for brightness and curtain position etc
* ClimateCard - control temperature from initial card (popup already has this but it's something that users may want at a glance)
* AreaCard - Allow alternate layouts, users may not just want a picture of the area but rather an icon / name layout
* History - include existing history information on all cards as popup similar to home assistant
* Theme - allow individual components to display different theme control, either by a hue shift or global change
* Architecture - currently, @hakit/components is bundled in one big package, I would like to change this so assets are bundled separately and only loaded when needed to reduce bundle size



### Long Term

* Full responsive layouts with the hope of an editor with drag and drop support.
