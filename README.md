### Get Started
There's an npm create command which will setup react, typescript, vite & hakit automatically for you with a terminal wizard!
```
  npm create hakit@latest
```

Or, if you want to install [@hakit/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/core) or [@hakit/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components) manually on an existing project:
```
  npm install @hakit/core @hakit/components
```

There's extensive [documentation](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit) which should give you all the information you need to get started!

### NEWS!

I'm working on a home assistant addon to create dashboards with these components, also making it easier to introduce custom components from the public and making it easier to apply style changes

### Known Issues
- Anything else? Please, if you notice anything that doesn't feel / look right, please report it, i rely on user testing to make improvements.

### What's next?

There's a Roadmap.md file with a few things i'm working on!
Have your say! Vote for what you'd like to see next in [upcoming features!](https://github.com/shannonhochkins/ha-component-kit/discussions/28), here's a few other small ideas i have!

- WeatherCard - Add more detailed options for related sensors like UV Index, wind chill, humidity etc
- EntitiesCard - Add Toggle for entities that support "toggle" service to allow an easy way to toggle/turnon/turnoff devices
- ButtonCard - Different layout designs, including slider indicator for brightness and curtain position etc
- ClimateCard - control temperature from initial card (popup already has this but it's something that users may want at a glance)
- RoomCard - Allow alternate layouts, users may not just want a picture of the room but rather an icon / name layout
- History - include existing history information on all cards as popup similar to home assistant
- CalendarCard - I do have a plan to integrate this, just need more time or help :) 

### Vision

homeassistant hacs integration - an integration that behaves similar to the lovelace dashboard, drag & drop, resizing, fluid containers using [react-grid-layoutd](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout) - storing the layouts inside home assistant, card picker for slots, would be a game changer! I would love some help with this part whilst im improving and adding cards / functionality
