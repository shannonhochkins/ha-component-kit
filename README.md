It provides components for you to use to create your own custom react Home Assistant dashboard.


### Get Started

There's detailed [documentation](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit) which should give you all the information you need to get started, a quick rundown to get you started:


1. Install the [ha-component-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ha-component-kit) package:

```bash
npm i ha-component-kit
```
2. Import the required components to authenticate with Home Assistant:

```ts
import { HassConnect, ThemeProvider } from 'ha-component-kit';
function App() {
  return <HassConnect hassUrl={HASS_URL}>
    <ThemeProvider />
    We are authenticated!
  </HassConnect>
}
```

3. That's it! You can now use the components to create your own custom dashboard for Home Assistant, see the [documentation](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit) for more details.

This is still a **WIP** and is subject to change, I will be making changes to this over the next few months to have a workable solution for multiple dashboards.
