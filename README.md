## Help me out?

As you can probably tell, 100s of hours have gone into this! I'd really appreciate a small donation as it will help me validate that my time is well spent and will guarantee future additional changes :) [Buy me a coffee!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jinglezzz)

### Get Started
There's an npm create command which will setup react, typescript, vite & hakit automatically for you with a terminal wizard!

```
  npm create hakit@latest
```

Or, if you want to install [@hakit/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/core) or [@hakit/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components) manually on an existing project:
```
  npm install @hakit/core @hakit/components
```

### Documentation

There's extensive [documentation](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit) which should give you all the information you need to get started!

### Home Assistant Addon
There's a [Home Assistant Addon](ADDON.md) available which will serve your dashboard to a new sidebar link in home assistant making it easier to access your custom dashboard.
