## Help me out?

Please, as you can probably tell, 100s of hours have gone into this! I'd really appreciate a small donation as it will help me validate that my time is well spent and will guarantee future additional changes :) [Buy me a coffee!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jinglezzz)

### Get Started
There's an npm create command which will setup react, typescript, vite & hakit automatically for you with a terminal wizard!

```
  npm create hakit@latest
```

Or, if you want to install [@hakit/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/core) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@hakit%2Fcore.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/core)  or [@hakit/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@hakit%2Fcomponents.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components) manually on an existing project:
```
  npm install @hakit/core @hakit/components
```

There's extensive [documentation](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit) which should give you all the information you need to get started!

### WIP - Next Release

- Theming - allow individual components to display different theme control, either by a hue shift or global change
 - WeatherCard - add more information in the popup, adjust the forecast functionality to align with the new upcoming [release](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/09/06/release-20239/#:~:text=With%20this%20change%2C%20the%20forecast,being%20updated%20all%20the%20time), will also convert the details prop to align with other cards, to accept children rather than a configuration object.

### What's next?

There's a Roadmap.md file with a few things i'm working on!
Have your say! Vote for what you'd like to see next in [upcoming features!](https://github.com/shannonhochkins/ha-component-kit/discussions/28)

### Vision

homeassistant hacs integration - an integration that behaves similar to the lovelace dashboard, drag & drop, resizing, fluid containers using [react-grid-layoutd](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout) - storing the layouts inside home assistant, card picker for slots, would be a game changer! I would love some help with this part whilst im improving and adding cards / functionality
