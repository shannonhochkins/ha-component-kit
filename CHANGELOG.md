# v.1.0.14
- Deprecating this package in favor of scoped packages to isolate certain "features" of this kit, now available under @hakit/core and @hakit/components
# v.1.0.13
##### released - 09/07/2023
- useApi hook redesigned, still works like it always has, however you can now just call useApi with no arguments `const api = useApi(); api('light').toggle('light.entity'), api('mediaPlayer').turnOn('mediaPlayer.entity')` etc
- useApi integrated into useEntity, so you can now call `const entity = useEntity('light.office_downlight'); console.log(entity.api.turnOn())`, this is the best way to utilize calls to home assistant as in almost every cause you'll want the entity as well as the api.
- domain name values can now be snake or camel case eg media_player.living_room_tv or mediaPlayer.living_room_tv
- services will remain as camelCase as we chain these methods together, eg `entity.api.turnOn()` and i think this is nicer
- refactored some of the type helpers
- Adding tests for some of the more complex hooks to ensure they continue to work
- callService now supports snake and camel case service names and domain names
- updating docs
- added a new layout prop to ButtonCard, removed "IconBackgroundColor" as this is controlled via css variables

# v.1.0.10
##### released - 07/07/2023
- ButtonCard no longer needs the "domain" prop, this is now inferred from the entity name, full type validation is still available, if you add entity="mediaPlayer.living_room_tv" the service prop will be validated with all the available services for the media_player domain.
- ButtonCard - now highlights the current colour of the light over the icon and behind the icon
- ButtonCard - has a small layout change to make it more compact
- useEntity - will now return a "custom" object on the HassEntity object containing additional information, for a light, you'll get a bunch of css variables related to the attributes of the colour value of the light, eg brightness, rgba, rgb, and hex values, additionally the "1 minute ago" time value is also available here.
