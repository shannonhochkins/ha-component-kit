# 2.2.0
## @hakit/components
- BREAKING - renamed RoomCard to AreaCard to align with naming convention of home assistant seeing as they use "areas" rather than "rooms". RoomCard is still available but marked as deprecated, this will be removed in future releases.
- BUGFIX - styles with calendar card have been fixed for a few issues
- BUGFIX - CalendarCard was previously requesting events multiple times initially on load.
- NEW - added loading indicator to CalendarCard
- BUGFIX - styles for GroupCard were too generic and inheriting on child components, this has been fixed.
- BUGFIX - SensorCard will now only show the pointer cursor if the onClick prop is provided.
- NEW - SensorCard now has the ability to hide the graph similar to home assistant.
## @hakit/core
- BREAKING - useApi renamed to useService - the previous name is misleading as it isn't the rest api but rather a proxy for websocket services, this is now renamed to useService to align with the home assistant api. useApi is still available but will be removed in future versions as this will in the future be the actual rest api helper hook.
- BREAKING - useEntity still returns the .api property to toggle actions and marked as deprecated, however this has been renamed to .service to align with it's core functionality which is triggering services.
- NEW - Added useAreas hook to retrieve all areas from home assistant including related devices, entities and services, all information in home assistant is available from the picture, name down to the devices and entities, this hook uses three subscription models to achieve this which are also available from core:
  - NEW - subscribeAreaRegistry - a subscription model to return all areas from home assistant
  - NEW - subscribeEntityRegistry - a subscription model to return all entities from home assistant
  - NEW - subscribeDeviceRegistry - a subscription model to return all devices from home assistant
- BUGFIX - useHistory hook which is used by every component behind the scenes, was previously subscribing far too many times, this has been fixed and should improve performance and less invalid socket connections.

# 2.1.2
## @hakit/components
- NEW - CalendarCard - A new component that replicates the same functionality as home assistants calendar
- NEW - ButtonGroup - A shared component to group buttons together, this is used by the CalendarCard for the views
- BUGFIX - ButtonCard / FabCard on click will now return the event in the onClick callback
- BUGFIX - ButtonCard / FabCard - "active" color now changed to accent color so it's clear what's active
- NEW - FabCard - can now specify the borderRadius as a prop which also updates the ripple

## @hakit/core
- NEW - callApi - a new function returned from useHass() to trigger an api request! This requires some setup in the configuration.yaml file which is documented in the docs.
- Updated home-assistant-js-websocket to latest version
- BUGFIX - The auth flow with home assistant the first time triggers a bad request with the auth token, however a simple refresh fixes this so i've included this into the workflow to ensure the first time you authenticate, it will refresh the page to ensure the auth token is valid.

## @hakit/create
- fixed a few small bugs where missing dependencies weren't included by default

# 2.1.1
## @hakit/components
- Small style fixes for the new button card layouts
- updating some documentation
## @hakit/core
- Updating types after latest home assistant release
# 2.1.0

## @hakit/components
- NEW - ButtonCard - slim and slim-vertical layout options added (preview available on the storybook home page) - These mimic the styles of the Mushroom cards from home assistant, additionally in preparation for the HA addon, there's now more customizable props to hide / show certain information on the card.
- NEW - ThemeProvider - globalStyles - a new prop available to pass a string literal of css to be applied globally to the document, this is useful for adding fonts or other global styles.
- NEW - cssStyles - a prop available on every single component to provide custom isolated styles for individual components, this supports styled css, meaning you can write selectors similar to scss, ie:
```
  cssStyles={`
    .my-custom-class {
      background-color: var(--ha-S50);
      .something-else {
        color: var(--ha-S50-contrast);
      }
    }
  `}
```
  This feature was added for part of a feature that will be added to the home assistant addon so users can write css in the UI.
- NEW - classNames - have been added to nearly every element as an identifier in preparation for the css overrides prop above, this will allow you to target specific elements and override the styles.
- HOTFIX - Modal - previously, if you included two ButtonCards with the same entity, the modals would clash and the animations were failing to render correctly, this can now be fixed by providing and id attribute as well as the entity.
- HOTFIX - There was many components who's types didn't have the correct extended props not allowing you to add standard HTML properties which has been fixed.

## @hakit/core
- NEW - serviceWhitelist and serviceBlacklist added to syncTypes script, this allows you to filter out services that you don't want to sync to your local types.
- HOTFIX - CLI script had a few missing params for options which have been addressed.
- HOTFIX - Types for Row/Column were previously littered with every available prop from react/emotion which has been addressed.



# 2.0.3
## @hakit/components
- Small improvements to Tooltip and Modal to provide better classnames for elements for re-styling
## @hakit/core - no changes

## @hakit/core

# 2.0.1
## @hakit/components
- BUGFIX - sensor card demo wasn't displaying the mock data correctly to indicate how it behaves, now generates random data for this particular demo
- BUGFIX - sensor card previously was showing the scale animation and ripple effect when clicking on the card, this has been removed unless the onClick function is provided.
- NEW - WeatherCard - now has the ability to provide additional sensors/details via the new details prop
- NEW - WeatherCard - previously if the forecast was set to daily, it was trying to cram 24 hours worth of data into the card, this has been limited to 10 items for desktop and 7 for mobile (for hourly & daily)
- NEW - WeatherCard - the time can be included in the forecast under the day value by default now, this can be removed by providing the includeTime as false
- NEW - WeatherCard - now has the "feels like" or "apparent temperature" value displayed in the card if available, there's calculations to determine this if it's not available using wind / chill index. By default, this attempts to read the "apparent_temperature" attribute on the weather entity, if this property is different for you then you can provide the "apparentTemperatureAttribute" prop to override this.
- BUGFIX - RoomCard / Modal previously had some padding issues for mobile, I've removed the inner padding on modals and popups and allowing the user to decide if padding should be included in the template within.
## @hakit/core - no changes

# 2.0.0

## @hakit/components
- NEW - Sensor card - Very similar to the home assistant SensorCard, this card will display the current state of the sensor, additionally you can add a graph to display the history of the sensor, this is a very powerful card and can be used for many different sensors.
- CHANGE - Another change to responsive layouts, previously under the theme object, you could control the width of cards, this has been removed in favor of responsive design, the cards have been specifically designed to fill the available space and will automatically layout in columns / rows with a default nice fluid width
- BUGFIX - fixed bug with RangeSlider which was causing flickering with media player card.
## @hakit/core
- BREAKING CHANGES - Complete refactor of the main core providers, after introducing history i noticed that every component was being re-rendered even when the entity used on a card/component wasn't changing, it was also causing child components to unmount and remount unexpectedly on every state change.
  1. HassConnect previously allowed a throttle value, this has been removed and moved to be controlled from the useEntity hook instead which has a default throttle of 150ms, this means that individual components can subscribe to updates either faster or slower than others.
  2. The store pattern is now using zustand to subscribe to updates which makes updates much more performant as we're only updating the state to values that we're subscribed to, this follows through to all hooks which means significant performance improvements.
  3. previously, the Provider had multiple useEffects causing multiple updates to the store values, this has been optimised dramatically.
  4. useHass - this was previously allowing access to internal store values, this has been refactored so only documented methods are available from useHass to avoid any mistaken use of the hook / store values, getEntity has also been removed from useHass in favor of the new hook useSubscribeEntity which will only update the component when the entity changes.
  5. NEW - useSubscribeEntity - a replacement for the getEntity function that was previously provided in useHass, logically it's also changed as you can only retrieve one entity with this hook so that it can subscribe to updates for an individual entity. If you need to retrieve multiple entities, you can retrieve the entities from the store, 
  ```
      const { getAllEntities } = useHass();
      // extract what you need from entities
      const entities = getAllEntities();
      // this is not the most optimal way to retrieve multiple entities as it will cause a rerender
      // on the component every time any entity changes
      
  ```
  6. NEW - useHistory - a hook to retrieve history for an entity, in it's raw form, it may be difficult to understand, so i've converted values to coordinates if you want to plot your own data.
  7. Fixed countless memory leaks
  8. useRoute has been renamed to getRoute from useHass.
  9. SceneCard has been removed and renamed to TriggerCard
  10. useEntity will now by default return history for the entity, you can control the options for this in the options object as the second argument.

# 1.1.1
## @hakit/components
 - Massive changes to responsive layout, all cards / components now have changes to styles based on screen size.

## 1.1.0
- NEW - Massive changes to the core styles for components, ThemeProvider now accepts hue, saturation, lightness, tint, contrastThreshold and darkMode as props, light/dark mode fully supported, interactive color sliders to visualize the theme changes on the overview page and on every single storybook component page. The default colors have also been changed which is why this has been released as a new minor release. If you prefer the grayscale look of previous versions, set the "tint" prop to 0 for ThemeProvider
- CHANGE - ClimateCard - now has tooltips for hvac actions, and more information displayed under the title at a glance.
- NEW - scroll-bars have been re-themed and supported in more browsers
- NEW - RangeSlider - a simple slider to get/set values between a min/max range
- NEW - Title - a new component to display titles which has been connected to some components by default to help display more information about the entities.
- BUGFIX - multiple styling bug fixes, every component has been touched at some point during this refactor to ensure the styles are consistent and work as expected for the new Theme controls.
- BUGFIX - animations with sidebar were really jumpy before, this has been fixed.
- BUGFIX - RoomCard popup never had overflow set when the content was larger than the screen, this has been fixed, additionally by default content is now aligned to the top not the center.
- BREAKING - the entire theme module has been rebuilt, if you were using any of the default css variables like --ha-text or --ha-primary-x or --ha-secondary-x etc, these have been deprecated.

# @hakit/core

  @hakit/components

  - BREAKING - This is a breaking change for all those using the SceneCard which has been renamed to TriggerCard to support other entities like automations, scripts etc. that you may want to trigger once, it will no longer automatically call 'turnOn', this is now expected to be handled via the onClick handler which returns the entity with the api attached, eg `onClick={(entity) => entity.api.turnOn()}` the SceneCard is still available and marked as Deprecated in the docs, it will be removed in the next few releases.
  - NEW - components will now show buttons in a disabled mode when the entity is unavailable or unknown

  - NEW - Alert - a shared component to display warnings or alerts, currently used by the ErrorBoundaries that have been introduced
  - NEW - components that use single domain entities (eg ClimateCard or ColorPicker etc) will now have correct intellisense on available entities if the types are synced.

- useApi hook redesigned, still works like it always has, however you can now just call useApi with no arguments `const api = useApi(); api('light').toggle('light.entity'), api('mediaPlayer').turnOn('mediaPlayer.entity')` etc
- useApi integrated into useEntity, so you can now call `const entity = useEntity('light.office_downlight'); console.log(entity.api.turnOn())`, this is the best way to utilize calls to home assistant as in almost every cause you'll want the entity as well as the api.
- domain name values can now be snake or camel case eg media_player.living_room_tv or mediaPlayer.living_room_tv
- services will remain as camelCase as we chain these methods together, eg `entity.api.turnOn()` and i think this is nicer

# v.1.0.10
##### released - 07/07/2023

- ButtonCard - now highlights the current colour of the light over the icon and behind the icon
- ButtonCard - has a small layout change to make it more compact
- useEntity - will now return a "custom" object on the HassEntity object containing additional information, for a light, you'll get a bunch of css variables related to the attributes of the colour value of the light, eg brightness, rgba, rgb, and hex values, additionally the "1 minute ago" time value is also available here.
