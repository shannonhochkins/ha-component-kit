# useService()
###### `useService(domain?: SnakeOrCamelDomain, rootTarget?: Target)`
This hook is designed to make it easy to make service calls programmatically.

This is a memoized wrapper for the [callService()](/docs/core-hooks-usehass-hass-callservice--docs) helper from [useHass()](/docs/core-hooks-usehass--docs) to make it
easier to call services.

**Note:** There's extensive types available for typescript developers to make it very easy to develop and call actions with the available types for different
services, if a service isn't available in the types or the params are different / incorrect to what you're expecting you can extend these [here](/docs/introduction-typescriptsync--docs).

This hook should be used inside the context of [`<HassConnect />`](/docs/core-hassconnect--docs) and not outside of it otherwise it will not have access to
the authenticated home assistant API.

### Preferred usage
The `useService()` hook is integrated with the `useEntity` hook so you can use it directly from the entity object.
Everything is typed so it makes it very easy to use and develop with.

<Source dark code={preferredExample} />

### Service level usage
We can use the hook to retrieve all the available services for a specific domain, eg "light, mediaPlayer etc...".
<Source dark code={serviceLevel} />

## Root level usage
We can also use the hook to retrieve all the available services and use them as needed.
<Source dark code={rootLevel} />

## Attach entity to root hook
We can use the `rootTarget` param to tell the hook that every call will be bound to one particular entity.
<Source dark code={rootTarget} />

## Returning a response
Some services return a response, like the calendar `getEvents` service, you can access this response value by adding `returnResponse` to the service call.
The response object type is able to be defined by passing a generic type to the service call itself, see example below:
