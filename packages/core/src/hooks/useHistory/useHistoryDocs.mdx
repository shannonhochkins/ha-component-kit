# useHistory()
###### `useHistory(entityId: EntityName, options: HistoryOptions)`
This hook is designed to retrieve the current history information from the entitiy if available.

> <b>NOTE:</b> This hook is already connected to the useEntity hook and returned as part of the entity object so you may never need to use this directly.

This will automatically subscribe/unsubscribe for you so there's no need to manage anything.
