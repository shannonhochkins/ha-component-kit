# useLightBrightness()
###### `useLightBrightness(entity: HassEntityWithService<"light">)`

The `useLightBrightness` hook is a custom React hook that calculates the brightness percentage of a light entity in a Home Assistant environment.

Here's a detailed description:

- **Input**: The hook takes a single argument, entity, which is an object representing a Home Assistant light entity with its associated services.
- **Output**: The hook returns a memoized value representing the brightness percentage of the light.
- **Logic**:
  - If the light is in the "ON" state, it calculates the brightness percentage by converting the brightness attribute (which ranges from 0 to 255) to a percentage (0 to 100). It ensures that the minimum brightness percentage is 1%.
  - If the light is not in the "ON" state, it returns 0, indicating that the light is off.
- **Dependencies**: The memoized value is recalculated whenever the brightness attribute or the state of the entity changes.
This hook is useful for efficiently managing and displaying the brightness level of a light in a React component, ensuring that the calculation is only performed when necessary.
