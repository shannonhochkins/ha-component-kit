# callService()
###### `callService(args: CallServiceArgs<ResponseType, SnakeOrCamelDomain, DomainService<SnakeOrCamelDomain>>)`
The call service helper will allow you to trigger any action in home assistant.

> Note: We recommend you use the [useEntity()](/docs/core-hooks-useentity--docs) hook or the [useService()](/docs/core-hooks-useservice--docs) hook as these are more user friendly and don't require you to type out all generic inputs for typescript.

If you have typescript, there's full intellisense on a large range of domains/service/data, if not, you can use developer tools enabled in home assistant,
navigate to this inside your instance, here you'll see a dropdown list and if you open this you'll see there's a "sub title" under each dropdown option, eg "climate.turn_on", in this particular example, "climate" is the domain and "turn_on" is the service.

This is an easy way to visualize all the available domains/service for your home assistant instance.

### Definition
<Source dark language="ts" code={callServiceDefinition} />

### Example Usage

<Source dark language="ts" code={callServiceUsage} />

### Returning a response
Some services return a response, like the calendar `get_events` service, you can access this response value by adding `returnResponse` to the service call.
The response object type is able to be defined by passing a generic type to the service call itself, see example below:

<Source dark language="ts" code={callServiceResponse} />
