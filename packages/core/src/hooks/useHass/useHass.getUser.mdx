# getUser()
This will return all information about the current user from the authenticated instance from your Home Assistant instance, this is all typed with typescript
so you'll have access to what's available on the object with the `HassUser` type.

This may be useful if you want to extract the name or perform different UI updates based on the role of the logged in user.

> It's preferred to use the {<a onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  redirectToStory('/docs/core-hooks-useuser--docs')
}}>useUser</a>} hook to get the user object, but if you need to get the user object outside of a hook, you can use this method.
