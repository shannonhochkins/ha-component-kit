# useHass()
This hook will return you a set of functions that you can use to interact with your home assistant instance.


This hook should be used inside the context of `<HassConnect />` and not outside of it otherwise it will not have access to
the authenticated home assistant API.

### Example Usage

```ts
import { HassConnect, useHass } from 'ha-component-kit';
function Child() {
  const hass = useHass();
  const light = hass.getEntity('light.something');
  // can now access all properties relating to the light
  return light.state;
}
function App() {
  return <HassConnect hassUrl="http://localhost:1234">
    <Child />
  </HassConnect>
}
