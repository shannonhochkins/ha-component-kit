# useHass()
This hook will return you a set of functions that you can use to interact with your home assistant instance.

This hook should be used inside the context of [`<HassConnect />`](/docs/core-hassconnect--docs) and not outside of it otherwise it will not have access to
the authenticated home assistant API.

### Example Usage

<Source dark language="ts" code={useHassExample} />
