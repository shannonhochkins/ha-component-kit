# useStore: UseStoreHook
This will return all the information from the store, you can also pass through a selector through as the function to only
subscribe to updates for that particular value.


### Example Usage

<Source dark language="ts" code={useStoreExample} />

### Returned object from `useStore`

> There's a lot more returned by the useStore method, these are intentionally undocumented as they're not intended to be used directly and there's hooks already exposing pretty much all this information, for example <Redirect to="/docs/core-hooks-useuser--docs">useUser</Redirect>.

### Returned Value

<ArgTypes of={DummyComponent} include={DATA_KEYS} />
