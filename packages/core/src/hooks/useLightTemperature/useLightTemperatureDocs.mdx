# useLightTemperature()
###### `useLightTemperature(entity: HassEntityWithService<"light">): number | undefined`

The `useLightTemperature` hook is a custom React hook that calculates the color temperature of a light entity in a Home Assistant environment.

Here's a detailed description:

- **Input**: The hook takes a single argument, `entity`, which is an object representing a Home Assistant light entity with its associated services.
- **Output**: The hook returns the color temperature of the light in Kelvin if the light is on and in color temperature mode; otherwise, it returns `undefined`.
- **Logic**:
  - The hook uses `useMemo` to memoize the result, ensuring that the calculation is only performed when the relevant dependencies change.
  - If the light's state is `ON` and its color mode is `COLOR_TEMP`, it returns the `color_temp_kelvin` attribute of the light entity.
  - If the light is off or not in color temperature mode, it returns `undefined`.
- **Dependencies**: The memoized value is recalculated whenever the state, `color_mode`, or `color_temp_kelvin` attributes of the entity change.

This hook is useful for efficiently managing and displaying the color temperature of a light in a React component, ensuring that the calculation is only performed when necessary.
