# Overview
The [@hakit/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/core) package uses the official [Home Assistant Web Socket](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-js-websocket) package to provide all the core functionality to authenticate with Home Assistant to create a dynamic dashboard with React! The [@hakit/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components) package houses reusable components for creating custom dashboards for Home Assistant using react.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Node.js** version 18 or higher. If you do not have Node.js installed, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** version 7 or higher. npm is distributed with Node.js - when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
- **hassToken** technically not required, but recommended you create a <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token" target="_blank">Long Lived Access Token</a> to provide to `HassConnect`. Long-lived access tokens can be created using the "Long-Lived Access Tokens" section at the bottom of your [Home Assistant profile](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile/) page under the "security" tab.


## Automated Setup Steps
There's an npm create command which will setup React, Typescript, Vite & Hakit automatically for you with a terminal wizard!

<Source dark code={`npm create hakit@latest`} />

Follow the terminal prompts to setup your new project! All steps will be provided to you in the terminal.
