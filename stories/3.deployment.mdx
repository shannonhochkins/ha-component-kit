## Deploying to Home Assistant

Home Assistant is bundled with a http server, specifically under `config/www` you can provide anything into this section and access via the `/local` pathname, which we can utilize to host our new dashboard, we do need to gather/setup some credentials to get going:

## Prerequisites

1. Setup project using the [getting started guide](/docs/introduction-getting-started--docs)
2. SSH Credentials setup - [Instructions](/docs/introduction-deploying-ssh-credentials--docs)

You should be able to run `npm run build && npm run deploy` and your dashboard should be available, a link will be logged in the terminal.

Now you should be able to access your dashboard (assuming you haven't changed the `VITE_FOLDER_NAME` in the environment variables):

[http://homeassistant.local:8123/local/ha-dashboard/index.html](http://homeassistant.local:8123/local/ha-dashboard/index.html)

or with Nabucasa:

[https://YOUR_NABU_CASA_ID.ui.nabu.casa/local/ha-dashboard/index.html](https://YOUR_NABU_CASA_ID.ui.nabu.casa/local/ha-dashboard/index.html)
