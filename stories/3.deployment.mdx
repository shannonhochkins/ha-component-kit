## Deploying to Home Assistant

Once you've built your new dashboard and you're happy with it locally, we can setup a script to copy the files over to home assistant automatically!

Homeassistant is served with a webserver, which we can utilize to host our new dashboard. To do this, we need to copy the `dist` folder to our home assistant instance.
The simplest way to copy your website to home assistant, is to copy your distributable files from your dashboard you've just created into the `www` folder of your home assistant configuration directory.

There's many ways to copy it, you can simply use the files exporer and copy it over, or you can use the `scp` command to copy it over with a script:

1. In Homeassistant: Install and setup the Terminal & SSH addon, this is very easy!
  - Click on your "Profile name" in your HA dashboard
  - Scroll down and enabled "Advanced mode"
  - Go to Settings -> Addons -> search for "Terminal & SSH" -> Install
  - Go to the configuration tab, enter a password into the field and save
  - Ensure the PORT is 22, save, the default username is `root`
2. In your react project, Install scp & dotenv, this is a very easy way to copy files over ssh:

```bash
npm install --save dotenv node-scp
# or
yarn add dotenv node-scp
```

3. In your project at the root level, create a file called `deploy.ts` and add the following code:

```ts
import { Client } from 'node-scp';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const USERNAME = process.env.SSH_USERNAME;
const PASSWORD = process.env.SSH_PASSWORD;
const HOST_OR_IP_ADDRESS = process.env.SSH_HOSTNAME;
const PORT = 22;
const REMOTE_FOLDER_NAME = 'dashboard'; // the folder name you want to copy the files to
const LOCAL_DIRECTORY = './dist'; // the pathname to your output files from your react project.

const REMOTE_PATH = `/config/www/${REMOTE_FOLDER_NAME}`;


async function deploy() {
  try {
    const client = await Client({
      host: HOST_OR_IP_ADDRESS,
      port: PORT,
      username: USERNAME,
      password: PASSWORD,
      // if you have extra security, here's how you can use the privateKey / passphrase
      // privateKey: fs.readFileSync('./key.pem'),
      // passphrase: 'your key passphrase',
    })
    // empty the directory initially so we remove anything that doesn't need to be there
    try {
      await client.rmdir(REMOTE_PATH);
    } catch (e) {
      // directory may not exist, ignore
    }
    // upload the folder to your home assistant server
    await client.uploadDir(LOCAL_DIRECTORY, REMOTE_PATH);
    client.close() // remember to close connection after you finish
    console.log('Successfully deployed!')
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Error:', e.message)
  }
}

deploy()
```

4. In your project, create a file called `.env` and add the following code:

```bash
SSH_USERNAME=root
SSH_PASSWORD=yourpassword # the password you set in the addon
SSH_HOSTNAME=yourhostname # your home assistant hostname or IP address, if you get EHOSTUNREACH when connecting, try your IP address `ping homeassistant.local` to get your IP address
```

5. in your package.json under `"scripts"`, add `"deploy": "npx tsx ./deploy.ts"` and run `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`

Now you should be able to access your dashboard (assuming you haven't changed the `REMOTE_FOLDER_NAME` in the script):
