## Deploying to Home Assistant

To setup a project with @hakit, you can use the following command:

```
  npm create hakit@latest
```

This script will completely scaffold your project, produce documentation for the next steps in the README.md file, and a really quick way to get up and going!

There is some further information required to get the deploy script working, so please read on.

Homeassistant is bundled with a webserver, which we can utilize to host our new dashboard, we do need to gather/setup some credentials to get going:

## Retrieving SSH Credentials

1. In Homeassistant: Install and setup the Terminal & SSH addon, this is very easy!
  - Click on your "Profile name" in your HA dashboard
  - Scroll down and enabled "Advanced mode"
  - Go to Settings -> Addons -> search for "Terminal & SSH" -> Install
  - Go to the configuration tab, enter a password into the field and save
  - Ensure the PORT is 22, save, the default username is `root`
2. Finally, update the .env file that's created with the `create hakit` script, or add it to your project manually:

```bash
VITE_HA_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 # your home assistant hostname or IP address
VITE_FOLDER_NAME=ha-dashboard # the folder name you want to copy the files to, this should also match the base name in the vite.config.ts `base: '/local/ha-dashboard/'`
VITE_SSH_USERNAME=root # the default username is root, if you changed this, change this value
VITE_SSH_PASSWORD=yourpassword # the password you set in the addon
VITE_SSH_HOSTNAME=yourhostname # your home assistant hostname or IP address, if you get EHOSTUNREACH when connecting, try your IP address `ping homeassistant.local` to get your IP address
```

The `VITE_HA_TOKEN` instructions can be found [here](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit/?path=/docs/introduction-typescriptsync--docs) under the pre-requisites section.

That's it! You should be able to run `npm run build && npm run deploy` and your dashboard should be available at a link printed in the terminal!

## Home Assistant Addon

If you want to use the HAKIT addon for home assistant so you can access your custom dashboard from your home assistant sidebar, you can install and follow the [setup steps here](https://github.com/shannonhochkins/ha-component-kit/blob/master/ADDON.md)

## Manual Deployment Script
Once you've built your new dashboard and you're happy with it locally, we can setup a script to copy the files over to home assistant automatically!

If you're attempting to update an existing project, we need to copy the `dist` folder to our home assistant instance.
The simplest way to copy your website to home assistant, is to copy your distributable files from your dashboard you've just created into the `www` folder of your home assistant configuration directory.
There's many ways to copy it, you can simply use the files exporer and copy it over, or you can use the `scp` command to copy it over with a script:

1. In your react project, Install scp & dotenv, this is a very easy way to copy files over ssh:
```bash
npm install --save dotenv node-scp
# or
yarn add dotenv node-scp
```
2. In your project at the root level, create a file called `deploy.ts` and add the following code:

```ts
import { Client } from 'node-scp';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { join } from 'path';
import { access, constants } from 'fs/promises';
dotenv.config();

const HA_URL = process.env.VITE_HA_URL;
const USERNAME = process.env.VITE_SSH_USERNAME;
const PASSWORD = process.env.VITE_SSH_PASSWORD;
const HOST_OR_IP_ADDRESS = process.env.VITE_SSH_HOSTNAME;
const PORT = 22;
const REMOTE_FOLDER_NAME = process.env.VITE_FOLDER_NAME;
const LOCAL_DIRECTORY = './dist';
const REMOTE_PATH = `/config/www/${REMOTE_FOLDER_NAME}`;

async function checkDirectoryExists() {
  try {
    await access(LOCAL_DIRECTORY, constants.F_OK);
    return true;
  } catch (err) {
    return false;
  }
}

async function deploy() {
  try {
    if (!HA_URL) {
      throw new Error('Missing VITE_HA_URL in .env file');
    }
    if (!REMOTE_FOLDER_NAME) {
      throw new Error('Missing VITE_FOLDER_NAME in .env file');
    }
    if (!USERNAME) {
      throw new Error('Missing VITE_SSH_USERNAME in .env file');
    }
    if (!PASSWORD) {
      throw new Error('Missing VITE_SSH_PASSWORD in .env file');
    }
    if (!HOST_OR_IP_ADDRESS) {
      throw new Error('Missing VITE_SSH_HOSTNAME in .env file');
    }
    const exists = await checkDirectoryExists();
    if (!exists) {
      throw new Error('Missing ./dist directory, have you run `npm run build`?');
    }
    console.log(`Deploying to ${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@${HOST_OR_IP_ADDRESS}:${PORT}:${REMOTE_PATH}`)
    const client = await Client({
      host: HOST_OR_IP_ADDRESS,
      port: PORT,
      username: USERNAME,
      password: PASSWORD,
    })
    // empty the directory initially so we remove anything that doesn't need to be there
    try {
      await client.rmdir(REMOTE_PATH);
    } catch (e) {
      // directory may not exist, ignore
    }
    // upload the folder to your home assistant server
    await client.uploadDir(LOCAL_DIRECTORY, REMOTE_PATH);
    client.close() // remember to close connection after you finish
    console.log('\nSuccessfully deployed!');
    const url = join(HA_URL, '/local', REMOTE_FOLDER_NAME, '/index.html');
    console.log(`\n\nVISIT the following URL to preview your dashboard:\n`);
    console.log(url);
    console.log('\n\n');
  } catch (e: unknown) {
    console.log('Error:', e)
  }
}

deploy();
```

4. In your project, create a file called `.env` and add the following code, this setup assumes you're using VITE, adjust accordingly if you're not:

```bash
VITE_FOLDER_NAME=ha-dashboard
VITE_HA_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 # your home assistant hostname or IP address
VITE_SSH_USERNAME=root
VITE_SSH_PASSWORD=yourpassword # the password you set in the addon
VITE_SSH_HOSTNAME=yourhostname # your home assistant hostname or IP address, if you get EHOSTUNREACH when connecting, try your IP address `ping homeassistant.local` to get your IP address
```

5. in your package.json under `"scripts"`, add `"deploy": "npx ts-node --esm scripts/deploy.ts"` and run `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`

Now you should be able to access your dashboard (assuming you haven't changed the `REMOTE_FOLDER_NAME` in the script):
