## Manual Installation Steps
Install the [@hakit/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/core) for all authentication and react hooks, this is the all the core functionality you'll need, if you want to use some of the components I've built, also install [@hakit/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components):

<Source dark code={`npm i @hakit/core @hakit/components -D`} />
***Note: This package uses peerDependencies, npm version 4-6 will not install these automatically, you will need to install them [manually](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35207380/how-to-install-npm-peer-dependencies-automatically), npm version 7 and above will handle this automatically.***


### Sync typescript
There's an awesome sub-feature of this package that will generate types specific to your home assistant instance! It's recommended that you [follow this flow](/docs/introduction-typescriptsync--docs)!

### Authenticate

**In** your root component of your react application (usually App.tsx) wrap everything with the [HassConnect](/docs/core-hassconnect--docs) component, don't forget to include the `ThemeProvider` to get the default theme if you're using [@hakit/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components).

<Source dark code={`
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { HassConnect } from '@hakit/core';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@hakit/components';
// TODO: replace this with your home assistant url & token, recommended you place these in a .env file if you're deploying to github.
const HASS_URL = 'http://localhost:8123';
const HASS_TOKEN = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE';
function App() {
  return <HassConnect hassUrl={HASS_URL} hassToken={HASS_TOKEN}>
    <ThemeProvider includeThemeControls />
    <p>This will render when connected!</p>
  </HassConnect>
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(<App />);
`} />


### Deploying to Home Assistant
Once you're happy with your new dashboard, you can follow the steps to [deploy here](/docs/introduction-deploying--docs) which will guide you through the process of deploying your dashboard to Home Assistant!
