## Manual Installation Steps
Install the [@hakit/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/core) for all authentication and react hooks, this is the all the core functionality you'll need, if you want to use some of the components I've built, also install [@hakit/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components):

<Source dark code={`npm i @hakit/core @hakit/components -D`} />
***Note: This package uses peerDependencies, npm version 4-6 will not install these automatically, you will need to install them [manually](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35207380/how-to-install-npm-peer-dependencies-automatically), npm version 7 and above will handle this automatically.***


### Sync typescript
There's an awesome sub-feature of this package that will generate types specific to your home assistant instance! It's recommended that you [follow this flow](/docs/introduction-typescriptsync--docs)!

### Authenticate

**In** your root component of your react application (usually App.tsx) wrap everything with the [HassConnect](/docs/core-hassconnect--docs) component, don't forget to include the `ThemeProvider` to get the default theme if you're using [@hakit/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hakit/components).

<Source dark code={appExample} />


### Deploying to Home Assistant
Once you're happy with your new dashboard, you can follow the steps to [deploy here](/docs/introduction-deploying--docs) which will guide you through the process of deploying your dashboard to Home Assistant!
