            }}>breakpoints</a> for more info) a css class is available to use to conditionally style your components.</p>
      <p>When a breakpoint is active, the current breakpoint class will be added to the body of the document, for example if we&quot;re in the range for a `lg` breakpoint, the following will apply to the body:</p>
      <Source dark code={`<body class="bp-lg">...</body>`} />

      <p>You can use these classes to change your layout/design visually within your css rules.</p>
      <Source dark code={`
.bp-xxs {
  /* Extra Extra small Screen Size, active when below the breakpoint.xxs value */
}
.bp-xs {
  /* Extra small Screen Size, active between breakpoint.xxs and breakpoint.sm */
