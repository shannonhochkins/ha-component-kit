## Retrieving SSH Credentials

1. In Home Assistant: Install and setup the [Advanced SSH & Web Terminal](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh) addon, this is very easy!
  - Click on your "Profile name" in your HA dashboard
  - Scroll down and enable "Advanced mode"
  - Go to Settings -> Addons -> ADD-ON STORE for "SSH & Web Terminal" -> Install
  - Once installed, Go to the configuration tab, enter a password into the field and save
  - Change default password
  - The username has to be set to `root` (default is `hassio`).
  - The sftp flag has to be set to true (default is false, and true requires the username to be root).
  - Ensure the PORT is 22, save
2. Finally, update the .env file, or add it to your project manually:

```bash
...
VITE_SSH_USERNAME=root # the default username is root, if you changed this, change this value
VITE_SSH_PASSWORD=yourpassword # the password you set in the addon
VITE_SSH_HOSTNAME=yourhostname # your home assistant hostname or IP address, if you get EHOSTUNREACH when connecting, try your IP address `ping homeassistant.local` to get your IP address
```
