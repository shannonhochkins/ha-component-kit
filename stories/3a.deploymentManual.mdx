## Manual Deployment to Home Assistant

Home Assistant is bundled with a http server, specifically under `config/www` you can provide anything into this section and access via the `/local` pathname, which we can utilize to host our new dashboard, we do need to gather/setup some credentials to get going:

## Prerequisites

1. Create a deployment script, you can copy [deploy.ts](https://github.com/shannonhochkins/ha-component-kit/blob/master/packages/create-hakit/template/scripts/deploy.ts) script to your project and manipulate as needed to change paths/names.
2. SSH Credentials setup - [Instructions](/docs/introduction-deploying-ssh-credentials--docs)
3. Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root of your project with the necessary environment variables.
4. Add a deploy script to your package.json `"deploy": "npx tsc deploy.ts"`


You should be able build your application and run `npm run deploy` and your dashboard should be available at a link printed in the terminal!

Now you should be able to access your dashboard (assuming you haven't changed the `VITE_FOLDER_NAME` in the environment variables):

[http://homeassistant.local:8123/local/ha-dashboard/index.html](http://homeassistant.local:8123/local/ha-dashboard/index.html)

or with Nabucasa:

[https://YOUR_NABU_CASA_ID.ui.nabu.casa/local/ha-dashboard/index.html](https://YOUR_NABU_CASA_ID.ui.nabu.casa/local/ha-dashboard/index.html)
