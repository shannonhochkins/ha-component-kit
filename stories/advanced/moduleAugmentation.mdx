# Extending the API Types
There's quite a lot already available and predefined under the SupportedServices interface, however if there'same
something you'd like to add you can easily use module augmentation to extend the definition from this package.

Example, if you have a domain called "zigbee", a service called "toggle", additionally if the default params i've provided
don't match what you're expecting, you can overwrite them here by redeclaring them.

```ts
  import { SupportedServices, ServiceFunctionTypes, ServiceFunction } from 'ha-component-kit';
  declare module 'ha-component-kit' {
    interface SupportedServices<T extends ServiceFunctionTypes = 'target'> {
      // domain level grouping
      zigbee: {
        // toggle a zigbee device
        toggle: ServiceFunction<T, {
          // description for param 1
          param1: string;
          // description for param 2
          param2?: string;
        }>;
        // Remove a notification from the frontend.
        turnOff: ServiceFunction<T, {
          // description for param 1
          param1: string;
        }>;
      };
    }
  }
```
